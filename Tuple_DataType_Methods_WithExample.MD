Tuples in Python are immutable, meaning once they are created, their values cannot be changed (unlike lists). Because of this immutability, tuples have fewer methods compared to lists or sets. Here's a list of the methods available for `tuple` objects, followed by explanations and examples.

### List of `tuple` Methods
1. `count()`
2. `index()`

### Explanation and Examples

#### 1. `count(x)`
Returns the number of occurrences of the element `x` in the tuple.

```python
t = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4)
count_value = t.count(2)
print(count_value)  # Output: 2
```

#### 2. `index(x[, start[, end]])`
Returns the index of the first occurrence of the element `x`. You can also specify the search range using `start` and `end` arguments. Raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found.

```python
t = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4)
index_value = t.index(2)
print(index_value)  # Output: 1
```

### Important Points About Tuples:
- **Immutability**: Tuples cannot be modified (no adding, removing, or changing elements).
- **Slicing and Accessing**: You can still access elements or slice tuples similarly to lists.

Example of tuple access and slicing:

```python
t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# Access by index
print(t[1])  # Output: 2
# Slicing
print(t[1:3])  # Output: (2, 3)
```

Since tuples are immutable, they don't support methods like `append()`, `remove()`, or `pop()`. Instead, they provide a simple, lightweight container for storing ordered collections of items, which can be more efficient than lists in certain contexts.
